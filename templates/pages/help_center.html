            <p class="text-gray-400 text-sm leading-relaxed">
                When you place a bid, you are committing to buy the item if you are the highest bidder when the timer ends. 
                Funds are not deducted until you pay, but failure to pay may result in an account ban.
                Bids placed in the last minute will extend the timer by 30 seconds (Sniper Protection).
